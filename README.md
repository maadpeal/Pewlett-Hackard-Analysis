    - Of which two of them, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff, the ones that will be most affected between the two, add 
    up to 50,842 employees, which represents approximately 70% of all employees who are going to retire.(image C-1)

##### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    - There are 72,458, with which a program could be designed to help train the next generation that can replace them. (image B-1)
    - Only two employees will retire from the manager position, due to the nature of their position they probably will not be able 
    to collaborate to a great extent in the training of the next generation, in which case they will have to look for external 
    training programs for the people who will replace them.
    - We must take into account the number of employees who are about to retire, which represent approximately 30% of currently 
    active employees, if we want the company not to be affected by its performance due to lack of personnel, action must be taken 
    soon, the people who are eligible for mentorship are not sufficient to fill the vacant positions. (image F-1)
